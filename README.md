# Random Password Generator (Riddled with errors unfortunately)

## Changes I Made

I attempted to create a random password generator that would create a password based off the criteria input by the user through window prompts. I created functions that would randomly choose characters from each particular category to then make a part of the password. I ran into issues when it came to the generate button. The alerts wanted to start before the button was pressed and I could not resolve that issue. I also could not seem to figure out how to exclude the categories that the user did not want in their password.
